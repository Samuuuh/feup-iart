### Description
TenPair is a logic one player game in which the player must clear all the digits from the board by eliminating pairs of digits that are the same or that sum to 10. The fewer the number of moves, the better the score.

### Setup
We used the version 3.9.1 of Python.
We used Tkinter as graphic interface. In windows, it comes pre-installed with python.
However if you are using Linux, you need to ensure that you have tk installed. If you're using ubuntu, you can use one of the following command (depending on your python version)
> apt-get install python-tk

> apt-get install python3-tk

Run the program in terminal

> python main.py

> python3 main.py

After that, a graphic interface will appear and the user can choose the options.
