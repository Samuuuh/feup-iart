### Description
TenPair is a logic one player game in which the player must clear all the digits from the board by eliminating pairs of digits that are the same or that sum to 10. The fewer the number of moves, the better the score.

### Setup
We used the version 3.9.1 of Python.
We use Tkinter as graphic interface. In windows, it comes pre-installed with python.
However if you are using Linux, you need to ensure that you have tk installed
> sudo apt-get install tk 

Run the program in terminal
> python main.py
